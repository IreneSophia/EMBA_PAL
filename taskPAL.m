% This function presents the probabilistic associative learning (PAL) task 
% from the EMOPRED project. (c) Irene Sophia Plank, 
% irene.plank@med.uni-muenchen.de
% Participants are asked to choose between two emotion: happiness and fear.
% The images are presented for 150ms. Before the images appear, a tone is
% played for 300ms which can be predictive of the outcome of the emotion
% recognition task that follows. There are 336 trials.
% This function takes two inputs: 
% * subID        :  a string array with the subjects PID
% * eyeTracking  :  0 or 1 to choose eye tracking or not
% The function needs Psychtoolbox to function properly. If eye tracking has
% been chosen, then a LiveTracking Eye Tracker has to be connected and the
% LiveTrackToolbox for MATLAB has to be installed. The function is meant to
% be used without an external monitor. Using a second monitor can seriously
% mess up the timing. 
% The function continually saves behavioural data as well as eye tracking
% data if that option is chosen. Both files will be placed in the "Data"
% folder.
